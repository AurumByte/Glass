# Glass

Glass is a programming language made using C++ from scratch. <br />
Glass is an early-stage programming language made for beginners. Currently not much is implemented, however the developement for this language is going really well.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one), Glass is not officially completed and tested yet, but you can still use it to some make small projects, as of now Glass is only focused to run on Windows Operating System.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Glass`.

## The Plan
The plan for Glass is to make it a Powerful, High-Level, OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Language. In the future Glass can also be used to develop GUI applications and Games using OpenGL.

## Instructions
### Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine. <br />
- Mingw-w64
- Git-bash
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)

### How To Use
- To use or test this program, go to "scripts" folder and run "Build.bat" and wait for the program to compile.
- Then go to "bin" folder and open Command Prompt and type "Glass.exe" and the location of your file without quotes.
- If you haven't created your own then type the path of the sample programs with their name, in the "res" folder and explore those programs.
- If you want to create your own Glass program then create a new file with an extention of ".a" without quotes.
