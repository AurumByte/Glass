# Glass

Glass is a programming language made using C++ from scratch <br />
Glass is an early-stage programming language made for beginners, It is going to be a Powerful, High-Level, OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Language. You can even use Glass to develop GUI applications and you can also make Games using OpenGL with Glass. <br />
Currently not much is implemented, however the developement for this language is going really well.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one), Glass is not officially completed and tested yet, but you can still use it to some make small projects, on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Glass`.

## Instructions
### Requirments
You need to install the following on your device. <br />
- Mingw-w64
- Git-bash
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)

### How To Use
To use or test this program, go to "scripts" folder and run "Build.bat" and wait for the program to compile. Then go to "bin" folder and open Command Prompt and type "Glass.exe" and the location of your file without quotes. If you haven't created your own then type "..\res\Project.a" or "..\res\test.a" without quotes and explore the sample programs. If you want to create your own Glass program then create a new file with an extention of ".a" without quotes.
