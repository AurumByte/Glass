# Glass

Glass is a programming language made using C++ from scratch, also Glass is highly inspired by C# and Python in terms of syntax.

Glass is an early-stage programming language made for beginners. Currently not much is implemented, however the developement for this language is going really well.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one), Glass is not officially completed and tested yet, but you can still use it to make some small projects, as of now Glass is only focused to run on Windows Operating System.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Glass`.

## The Plan
The plan for Glass is to make it a Powerful, High-Level, OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Language. In the future Glass can also be used to develop GUI applications and Games using OpenGL (It's not confirmed that OpenGl will be used in Glass for Graphics rendering, We may use something else).

## Main Features to Come
- Loops (For loops, While loops)
- Conditional statements (If else statements, Switch statements)
- Functions
- Classes
- Namespaces
- Graphics rendering
- GUI application developement support
- Custom Library building support (By this feature you can make a Glass Library using ".glass" files only, this means you don't need to access the source code everytime you want to create a new Library for Glass)

And much more...

## Instructions
### Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine.<br />
- Mingw-w64
- Python
- Git-bash
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)

### How To Use
- To use or test this program, go to "scripts" folder and run "Build.bat" and wait for the program to compile.

- Then go to "bin" folder and open Command Prompt and type "Glass" and path of your file with it's name.

- If you haven't created your own then type path of those sample programs with their name, which exixt in "res/sample projects" folder.

- If you want to create your own Glass program then create a new file with an extention of ".glass" without quotes.

- Then go to "IDE/APremiere" folder and open APremiere.py to start coding.

## What is APremiere
APremiere is an IDE made for Glass programming language. I made this Code editor because as of now any other IDE such as VS-Code, Sublime Text 3, Visual Studio and others do not support Glass, they cannot provide intellisense, or color coding for this programming language. APremiere is also open source so you can modify it and help me to make it better.

## Devlog at Trello
You can now get it's developement log at: https://trello.com/b/xZ02JY5g/glass<br />

## Short Term Goals
By the end of 2021, we want to make Glass capable of handling massive console applications without any syntax complexity. Not like a test program, but this time with proper Loops, Functions, Classes, Variables, Conditional statements and much more. This means that we need to Optimize, Enhance, Powerfull and make Glass so much Easy to use.
