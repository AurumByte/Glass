Glass is an early-stage programming language made for beginners, It is going to be a Powerful, High-Level, OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Language. You can even use Glass to develop GUI applications and you can also make Games using OpenGL with Glass. Currently not much is implemented, however the developement for this language is going really well.
